                    Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves, characterized by feathers, 
                    toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, 
                    and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee 
                    hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half 
                    of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to 
                    species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved 
                    from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight 
                    in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory 
                    systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly 
                    seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.
