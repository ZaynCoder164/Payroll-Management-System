        <p style="padding: 16px; font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5;">The Solar System is made up of the Sun and all the objects that orbit around it. The Sun is orbited by planets, asteroids, 
            comets and other things. It is billions of years old.

        <p style="padding: 16px; font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5;">
            The Sun is a star. It contains 99.9% of the Solar System's mass. This means that it has strong gravity. The other objects are pulled into orbit around the Sun. The sun is mostly made out of hydrogen and helium.

            There are eight planets in the Solar System. From closest to farthest from the Sun, they are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The first four planets are called terrestrial planets. They are mostly made of rock and metal, and they are mostly solid. The last four planets are called gas giants. This is because they are much larger than other planets and are mostly made of gas.
