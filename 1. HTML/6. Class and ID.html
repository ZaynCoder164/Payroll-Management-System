        The Solar System is made up of the Sun and all the objects that orbit around it. The Sun is orbited by planets, asteroids, 
        comets and other things. It is billions of years old.

        The Earth is often compared to a majestic blue marble, especially by those privileged few who have gazed upon it from orbit. 
        This is due to the prevalence of water on the planetâ€™s surface. While water itself is not blue, water gives off blue light 
        upon reflection.

        For those of us confined to living on the surface, the fact that our world is mostly covered in water is a well known fact. But 
        how much of our planet is made up of water, exactly? Like most facts pertaining to our world, the answer is a little more 
        complicated than you might think, and takes into account a number of different qualifications.
